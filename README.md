# Month Calendar
This is a small zero-dependencies calendar app that can be used in many types of projects.

Right now, dates can be clicked on the calendar to highlight bookings and set on its date-ordered list.
No backend yet, so info is not saved (clears on refresh).

I intend to improve on it, towards making it a booked days tracking app for service providers (etc).
But for now, I'll do this only whenever I happen to work on code that fits the vision.

Feel free to use for your projects, and improvements are welcome.
